    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>The way we lead matters because it impacts people and all people matter.</h2>
        <p>Our framework is shaped by our core convictions of what we believe our leaders do: they deepen our faith; help shape our vision; form our culture; foster community; and ensure excellent practice.</p>
        <p>How leaders go about their task is equally important. At Carey our leaders display courage in the face of complexity and challenge; value creativity; are accountable; are aware of the need for sustainable practices; and operate in a way which is respectful, compassionate and kind.</p>
        <p>The intersection of these provides a rich vocabulary to characterise leadership at Carey. These words and concepts help us evaluate if we are on target as we aspire to provide the leadership Carey desires and needs.</p>
        <p>This framework words together with our <strong>Theological Architecture</strong> and <strong>Carey Voice</strong> documents, and the values and convictions expressed there should work together with the <strong>Leadership Framework</strong> when making decisions. All of these are enriched in an environment that values <strong>seeing</strong> and <strong>deep listening</strong>.</p>
